Based on the project [Planet Four: Terrains](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mschwamb/planet-four-terrains), we are trying to use machine learning and artifical neural networks to train a computer to be able to classify terrains in images of Mars (such as the image above). The original Planet Four project was a community effort, taking a brute-force and human-driven approach to classifying images of Mars. This project had various individuals from around the world classify over 20,000 images of Mars, placing them into various categories such as "Swiss", "Spiders", "Baby Spiders", "Craters", and "Channel Networks". However, the most import two classifcations highlighted in Planet Four's results was the swiss and spiders classification.
